# Exam Management System

#ABSTRACT 
There is a lot of manual work involved in the current system that is used in the arrangement of Examinations. 
The manual work that is involved in this process is difficult and prone to errors. 
The proposed system may provide a better way for the arrangement of Examinations. 
Most of the manual work will be reduced, thus ensuring an effective way to    conduct the Examination without any     complications.
The project generates the report about the seating arrangement that can be viewed by the administrator & students with proper login.
The proposed system is efficient, fast and accurate in comparision to the manual system.
The data objects of the system encompass the records of the students which include the semester wise and branch wise     seating arrangement during the conduct of the exams.
Our experimental results with real life data sets confirm the effectiveness and  robustness of our application compared to the state of art for manual processing involved in current procedure followed.
